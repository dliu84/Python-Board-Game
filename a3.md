## Part D: Reflection
### Le Chanh Tin Luong

1. Please detail what exactly you did for the assignment.
   
   - In assignment 3, I was mainly responsible for part A. I collaborated with my team to understand and update the Overflow function in a1_partd.py. Then in a3_parta.py, I did the evaluate_board function to calculate the score of the board. In part B, I collaborated with my teammates to get the correct idea behind the GameTree mechanism and the minimax algorithm in order to make the AI player work. In part C, I and my teammates worked together to try to improve and test the Undo function to pause the each player's turn for 5 seconds for the human player to undo their move. 

2. What was one thing you learned when doing this assignment?

   - One thing that I learned the most from this assignment is how to implement a game using a tree data structure and algorithm. I found out that a tree can take any form and shape, not just a binary tree. When I found out that the GameTree must have up to 28 children for the first nodes, I was worried that such implementation would take too much memory and time to run. However, after my team successfully implemented the GameTree, I found out that it was not that bad but actually quite fast for the AI player to make a move. Then I recognized how modern games generates the next suitable move for the AI player especially for board games like chess, it is by building a giant tree of all possible moves and then use the minimax algorithm to create a score for each scenerio to choose the best move for the AI player. But however, due to the nature of the GameTree expanding exponentially, we have to limit the depth of the tree to a certain number. And by limiting the depth of the tree, we can decide the smartness of the AI player.

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did you do to overcome this challenge?
  
   - The most challenging aspect of this assignment is to make improvements to the game.py. I found out that the game is built upon a great deal of functions from drawing the board and buttons and texts, to handling the player's input,  handling the AI player's move, handling the game events, and so on. Because of that, whenever my team tried to make a change to the game.py, we had to be very careful to not break the game but also has to look into the codes of each function to understand how it works. After we have the Undo function working basically, improving it to only appears for human player as well as pausing the AI player's turn for 5 seconds was also very challenging because we had to look into the game.py to understand how each function works and how they are connected to each other. We overcome this by focusing on one function at a time and try to look up the Internet to understand the code. Then we breaks down the functionalities of each improvement into smaller parts and try to implement them one by one. By doing so, we steadily making progress to the game and making debugging easier for smaller functions with specific functionalities.

   - In this last assignment, I was mainly responsible for part B, the GameTree Class. However, this assignment is not independent of other parts because you need part A to work with part B. It is like building on top of each other. That means I would have to work on part A to understand how the game works. Also, I did change
something in assignment 1 part D to work with this assignment too. For part B, I would have to understand how the game works and the concept of the game tree first because at first, I focused on trees that I have learned so I was quite confused about how to implement it. Then I had to read the instructions again and again, and also ask my groupmates about how they understood this assignment instruction and asked them to explain it to me.

2. What was one thing you learned when doing this assignment?
   
   - Some new concepts were introduced to me in this assignment. The main thing I learned about this concept of how to implement a game using a tree data structure and algorithm. In the beginning, I thought it would be a binary tree because that is what I mostly learned in class but it turned out to be a tree that has so many child nodes. For example, for the board game in this game, there were at least 28 children for just one node then it grew to be a lot of children along the way. Furthermore, I learned about the minimax algorithm that is used to implement the game that has two players when the first player wants to win while the other player wants the first player to lose.
     
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did you do to overcome this challenge?
   
   - This assignment is the most difficult one out of our 3 assignments in my opinion. So many challenging points are trying to finish this assignment. Firstly, I had never written a game in Python before so when I first saw the code, I got very overwhelmed and anxious. Secondly, I found the instructions very hard to comprehend because my mind was focusing on the wrong concept. And then, there are so many new concepts that I never learned before so it is very challenging for me.
To overcome all of these challenging aspects to google and try to learn about it as much as I can. For example, in the game.py I had to read through the code line by line slowly, and when I did not understand how the block of code worked. I would get that block of code and ask Chat GPT to explain it to me. Furthermore, for some new concepts such as the minimax algorithm, I watched many video clips about it on YouTube until I thoroughly understood how it works and how I could use in my assignment.

1. Please detail what exactly you did for the assignment.
   - In a3, I mainly contributed to part C - Game Improvement. I added an ```undo``` button for human players. The ```undo``` button reverts the game to a state before that human player's last move.

   - I used the ```Python``` built in data structure ```list``` in this part. I added a new attribute ```self.history``` in Board class to the store the current state of the board, I set this attribute initially empty list ```self.history = []```. When the user clicks the ```undo``` button, the ```undo()``` function is triggered and removes the top of the board history by using ```self.history.pop()```. After the board state is reverted, the player's turn has to be maintained to be the same player (human player).

2. What was one thing you learned when doing this assignment?
   - I learned how a board game is created in ```pygame```. This board game has ```Board``` class to define the board states, ```Dropdown``` class to define the dropdown menu, and our group added a ```Button``` class to handle the ```undo``` functionality. I also learned that how the board game machanics is designed, how to handle the player's input or play's turn, and how to implement the game logic. I am very interested in this board game, and I plan to delve into more games in my future studies.
     
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did you do to overcome this challenge?
   - The most challenging aspect is the game itself. I had no game experience before, and initially I knew nothing about this board game. After reading the ```game.py``` file many times, reading some questions and answers in ```stackoverflow``` , and watching videos on ```Youtube```, I gradually started to understand what the game is and how the game is playing. I initially implemented a ```button``` and it worked fine with both human players. However, when it came to the AI player, the AI player made a move instantly after a human's move and the human couldn't perform the ```undo``` functionality. I showed my work to the professor and he suggested that we delay the AI's move so that the human could have a short time to perform the ```undo``` functionality. I delayed the AI's move by ```5``` seconds. In this ```5```seconds period, the human can perform the ```undo``` functionality. After ```5``` seconds, the ```undo``` functionality does not work any more for human players. My team members also offered numerous valuable suggestions to enhance the optimization of my program.
